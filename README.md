## Lean = Lean Code + Lean Maschine
  The first implementation of bare (called Lean as a word play for Lín, western representation of the chinese 林 - forest) was done resembling the Java runtime, where an intermediate representation is produced from the source code (Lean Code) and it is then executed in a compatible machine (such as the Lean Maschine). You can check out more details covering from the rationale to a deep analysis of how bare came to be [right here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bwtWhC_AxdVxMREs_K065ps0y4MIXH4OhDtNnuXN6gI/edit?usp=sharing) (Pt-BR only).

## Running
